The Isolation Solution - Nasa Stay Home

## Overview

NASA Stay Home is a website that seeks to reduce the effects of social isolation through scientific communication. The goal is to build a gamified platform, with scoring and levels schemes, where the users will have challenges to play with his friends based on posts about NASA curiosities. In addition, we propose to bring science communicators, who are living on or off the Earth, on our platform to share their experiences and daily lives. Thus, people will be encouraged to don’t be isolated, but in a safer way.
